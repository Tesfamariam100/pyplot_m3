This project compares the execution times of two sorting algorithms: **Insertion Sort** and **Merge Sort**, based on different list sizes.

### Key Features:
- **Algorithms Compared**:
  - Insertion Sort
  - Merge Sort
- **Plot Types**:
  - Line plot with execution times on the y-axis and list sizes on the x-axis.
  - Scatter plot for visual comparison.
- **Visualization**:
  - Both algorithms' times are plotted on the same graph with distinct colors and markers.
  - Includes a legend to differentiate between the algorithms.

### Usage:
1. **Data**:
   - `sizes`: List sizes used for testing the sorting algorithms.
   - `insertion_sort_times`: Execution time for Insertion Sort.
   - `merge_sort_times`: Execution time for Merge Sort.

2. **Plot**:
   - Displays sorting times for both algorithms on the same graph.
   - Shows trends and performance comparisons across different list sizes.

### Requirements:
- matplotlib
- python (any version >= 3.x)

### Example:
```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Code to generate the plot as described above
